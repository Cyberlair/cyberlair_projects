# Cyberlair Projects

A collection of Python projects for freelancing.

## Projects
- `sum_numbers.py`: Takes 6 numbers from the user and prints their sum. Example: Input "1 2 3 4 5 6" outputs "21".
- `calculator.py`: Evaluates math expressions (e.g., 'tan(45)+2-3*sqrt(4)') and functions like 'sin(30)'. Supports long expressions (up to 12 terms), parentheses, exponentiation, square root, trigonometric functions, implicit multiplication (e.g., 'sin(30)2' as 'sin(30)*2'), standard precedence rules, and displays results with 6 decimal places. Example: Input "tan(45)+2-3*sqrt(4)" outputs "-3.000000", "sin(30)" outputs "0.500000".
- `number_guesser.py`: A number guessing game where the user guesses a random number between 0 and 111, with feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, and tracks the number of guesses. Example: Guess "50" for number 42 outputs "Too high! Try a lower number.", correct guess outputs "Congratulations! You guessed the number: 42" and "It took you 3 guesses."
- `rock_paper_scissors.py`: An interactive rock, paper, scissors game where the user competes against the computer, with the option to play multiple rounds. Example: Input "rock" against computer's "scissors" outputs "Computer chose: scissors" and "You win!".
